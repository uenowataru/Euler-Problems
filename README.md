Euler-Problems
==============

This repository will consist of solution set for Project Euler problems: http://projecteuler.net/problems
Motivated by my love for mathematics and challenges, I will solve all the problems I tackle with no help.

In addition, I will not look up optimal solutions so my code will probably not be the most optimal. That said, however, after getting the answer right by myself I do and will go through other good solutions (I am always curious as to what others have come up with and how I can improve my code).

I am primarily going to code my solutions in programming languages I am not familiar with.
