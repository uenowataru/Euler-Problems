Euler-Problems
==============

This repository will consist of solution set for Project Euler problems: http://projecteuler.net/problems

I will solve all the problems I tackle with no help. I will not look up optimal solutions so my code will probably not be the most optimal. That said, however, after getting the answer right by myself I do and will go through other good solutions to learn better methods.

I am primarily going to code my solutions in programming languages I am not familiar with.
